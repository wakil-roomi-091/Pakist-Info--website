                <dd>
                    Pakistan is a country in South Asia, bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan and Iran to the
                    west, and China to the north. It has a coastline along the Arabian Sea in the south. With a rich
                    history dating back thousands of years, Pakistan is known for its cultural diversity, natural
                    beauty, and strategic location. Islamabad is the capital city, and Karachi is the largest city. The
                    country’s official language is Urdu, while English is widely used in government and education

                    The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a sovereign state located in South Asia, covering an area of
                    881,913 square kilometers. It shares its borders with India to the east, Afghanistan and Iran to the
                    west, and China to the north, while the south is bounded by the Arabian Sea. Strategically
                    positioned at the crossroads of Central, South, and West Asia, Pakistan serves as a bridge between
                    diverse cultures and economies.

                    Pakistan has a population exceeding 240 million, making it the fifth most populous country in the
                    world. Islamabad is the federal capital, while Karachi is the largest metropolitan and economic hub.
                    Urdu is the national language, and English is widely used for official, legal, and business
                    purposes. The nation operates as a federal parliamentary republic.

                    The 1946 elections saw the Muslim League secure 90 percent of the Muslim seats, supported by the
                    landowners of Sindh and Punjab. This forced the Indian National Congress, initially skeptical of the
                    League's representation of Indian Muslims, to acknowledge its significance.[95] Jinnah's emergence
                    as the voice of the Indian Muslims,[55] compelled the British to consider their stance, despite
                    their reluctance to partition India. In a final attempt to prevent partition, they proposed the
                    Cabinet Mission Plan.[96]

                    As the Cabinet Mission failed, the British announced their intention to end rule by June
                    1948.[97][98] Following rigorous discussions involving Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma,
                    Muhammad Ali Jinnah of the All-India Muslim League, and Jawaharlal Nehru of Congress, the formal
                    declaration to partition British India into two independent dominions—namely Pakistan and India—was
                    issued by Mountbatten on the evening of 3 June 1947. In Mountbatten's oval office, the prime
                    ministers of around a dozen major princely states gathered to receive their copies of the plan
                    before its worldwide broadcast. At 7:00 P.M., All India Radio transmitted the public announcement,
                    starting with the viceroy's address, followed by individual speeches from Nehru, and Jinnah. The
                    founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah concluded his address with the slogan Pakistan Zindabad
                    (Long Live Pakistan).[99]

                    As the United Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India,[99] the modern state of Pakistan was
                    established on 14 August 1947 (27th of Ramadan in 1366 of the Islamic Calendar, considered to be the
                    most blessed date from an Islamic perspective).[100][101] This new nation amalgamated the
                    Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of British India, comprising the provinces of
                    Balochistan, East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab, and Sindh.[102]

                    In the riots that accompanied the partition in Punjab Province, between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people
                    were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions.[103] Around
                    50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men, while 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women
                    experienced the same fate at the hands of Muslims.[104] Around 6.5 million Muslims moved from India
                    to West Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from West Pakistan to India.[105] It was the
                    largest mass migration in human history.[106] A subsequent dispute over the princely state of Jammu
                    and Kashmir eventually sparked the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948

                    Pakistan's diverse geography and climate host a wide array of wildlife.[167] Covering 881,913 km2
                    (340,509 sq mi),[168] Pakistan's size is comparable to France and the UK combined.[169] It ranks as
                    the 33rd-largest nation by total area,[170] but this varies based on Kashmir's disputed status.
                    Pakistan boasts a 1,046 km (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman,[171][172]
                    and shares land borders totaling 6,774 km (4,209 mi), including 2,430 km (1,510 mi) with
                    Afghanistan, 523 km (325 mi) with China, 2,912 km (1,809 mi) with India, and 909 km (565 mi) with
                    Iran.[173] It has a maritime border with Oman,[174] and shares a border with Tajikistan via the
                    Wakhan Corridor.[175] Situated at the crossroads of South Asia, the Middle East, and Central
                    Asia,[176] Pakistan's location is geopolitically significant.[177] Geologically, Pakistan straddles
                    the Indus–Tsangpo Suture Zone and the Indian tectonic plate in Sindh and Punjab, while Balochistan
                    and most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sit on the Eurasian Plate, primarily on the Iranian plateau.
                    Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, along the Indian plate's edge, are susceptible to powerful
                    earthquakes.[178]


                    A satellite image showing the topography of Pakistan.[179]
                    Pakistan's landscapes vary from coastal plains to glaciated mountains, offering deserts, forests,
                    hills, and plateaus.[180] Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern
                    highlands, the Indus River plain, and the Balochistan Plateau.[181] The northern highlands feature
                    the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, and Pamir mountain ranges, hosting some of the world's highest peaks,
                    including five of the fourteen eight-thousanders (mountain peaks over 8,000 metres or 26,250 feet),
                    notably K2 (8,611 m or 28,251 ft) and Nanga Parbat (8,126 m or 26,660 ft).[182][183] The Balochistan
                    Plateau lies in the west and the Thar Desert in the east.[184][185][186] The 1,609 km (1,000 mi)
                    Indus River and its tributaries traverse the nation from Kashmir to the Arabian Sea, sustaining
                    alluvial plains along the Punjab and Sindh regions.[187]

                    The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a
                    monsoon season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly
                    less rainfall or none at all.[188] Pakistan experiences four distinct seasons: a cool, dry winter
                    from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season,
                    or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of
                    October and November.[189] Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, with patterns of alternate
                    flooding and drought common

                    Pakistan's economy ranks 25th globally by purchasing power parity (PPP) and 44th by nominal GDP.[391][399] Historically, Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region in the first millennium CE, but lost ground to regions like China and Western Europe by the 18th century.[400] Pakistan is a developing country,[401] and part of the Next Eleven, poised to become one of the world's largest economies in the 21st century, alongside the BRIC countries.[402]

In recent years, Pakistan has faced social instability and macroeconomic imbalances, with deficiencies in services like rail transportation and electrical energy generation.[403] The semi-industrialized economy has growth centers along the Indus River.[404][405][406] The diversified economies of Karachi and Punjab's urban centers coexist with less-developed areas in other parts of the country, particularly in Balochistan.[405] Pakistan ranks as the 67th-largest export economy and the 106th-most complex economy globally, with a negative trade balance of US$23.96 billion in fiscal year 2015–16

                </dt>
                <dd>
The Pakistani economy has shifted from agriculture to services, with agriculture contributing only 20.9% of the GDP as of 2015.[430] Despite this, Pakistan's wheat production in 2005 surpassed Africa's and nearly matched South America's, highlighting its agricultural significance.[431] The sector employs 43.5% of the labor force and is a major source of foreign exchange.[430][432]

Manufactured exports, heavily reliant on agricultural raw materials like cotton and hides, face inflationary pressures due to supply shortages and market disruptions. Pakistan ranks fifth in cotton production, self-sufficient in sugarcane, and the fourth-largest milk producer globally. Though land and water resources haven't increased proportionately, productivity gains, especially from the Green Revolution in the late 1960s and 1970s, significantly boosted wheat and rice yields. Private tube wells and High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) further augmented crop yields.[433] Meat industry accounts for 1.4 percent of overall GDP.

                    Industry, constituting 19.74% of GDP and 24% of total employment, is the second-largest sector. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) dominates, representing 12.2% of GDP, with cement production thriving due to demand from Afghanistan and the domestic real estate sector.[436] In 2013, Pakistan exported 7,708,557 metric tons of cement, with an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons.[437] The textile industry, a key player in Pakistan's manufacturing, contributes 9.5% to GDP and employs around 15 million people. As of 2022, Pakistan ranks seventh globally in cotton production,[438] with substantial spinning capacity, making it a major exporter of textile products in Asia.[439] China has been a significant buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion worth of textiles in 2012

                <dd>
                    With its diverse cultures, landscapes, and attractions, Pakistan drew around 6.6 million foreign tourists in 2018.[448] However, this was a decline from the peak of tourism in the 1970s driven by the popular Hippie trail.[449] Pakistan boasts attractions from mangroves in the south to Himalayan hill stations in the northeast, including ancient Buddhist ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Taxila, the 5,000-year-old Indus Valley civilization sites such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa,[450] and numerous mountain peaks over 7,000 metres (23,000 feet).[451] The northern part of Pakistan boasts numerous old fortresses, showcasing ancient architecture. It encompasses the Hunza and Chitral valleys, where the small pre-Islamic Kalasha community resides, claiming descent from Alexander the Great.[452] Lahore, Pakistan's cultural capital, showcases numerous examples of Mughal architecture, including the Badshahi Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens, the Tomb of Jahangir, and the Lahore Fort. Following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, The Guardian highlighted "The top five tourist sites in Pakistan" to boost tourism, featuring destinations like Taxila, Lahore, the Karakoram Highway, Karimabad, and Lake Saiful Muluk.[453] Festivals and government initiatives aim to promote Pakistan's cultural heritage.[454] In 2015, the World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan 125th out of 141 countries in its Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report
