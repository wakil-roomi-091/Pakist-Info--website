The history of Gilgit-Baltistan is marked by its position as a strategic crossroads linking South Asia, Central Asia, and China. Historically, it was part of various ancient empires, including the Mauryan Empire, and later influenced by Buddhist and Tibetan cultures. The region was an important center along the ancient Silk Road, facilitating trade and cultural exchange between East and West. During the medieval period, Gilgit-Baltistan came under the control of local rulers and various Muslim dynasties. In the 19th century, the British Empire extended its influence, establishing administrative control through the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. After the partition of British India in 1947, the region’s political status became contested, eventually becoming part of Pakistan-administered territory. Today, Gilgit-Baltistan retains its unique cultural identity while playing a vital role in Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape, especially due to its proximity to China and the development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
